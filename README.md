This is a simple python code to compute points coordinates in a 3D geodetic coordinate system from two photographs with overlapping

Entry: 
- Digital coordinates of points on the two photographs (tie points observed on photos)
- Initial values for Exterior Orientation parameters of the two photographs
- Geodetic coordinates of the ground control points

Exit: 
- Geodetic Tie points X, Y, Z
- Exterior orientation parameters calculated
- Residuals on the observations
